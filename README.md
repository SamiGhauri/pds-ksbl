# Problem Statement:

Airbnb is a popular platform for renting accommodation for vacation or business trips. With the growing popularity of Airbnb, hosts need to optimize their listings to attract guests and maximize their revenue. The purpose of this project is to analyze the Airbnb data for Lisbon city and provide insights to hosts on how to improve their listings. The analysis will cover the following areas:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: The Airbnb data for Lisbon city contains detailed information about the listings, including their location, amenities, availability, and price. The first step in the analysis will be to clean and prepare the data for analysis, including handling missing or incorrect values, converting data types, and creating new variables if needed.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Once the data is cleaned and prepared, we will perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of variables and identify patterns and trends. We will create visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to analyze the data and understand the characteristics of the Airbnb market in Lisbon city.

Basic Statistics: We will use Numpy and Pandas to compute basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation between variables. This analysis will help us understand the average price of listings in Lisbon city and the relationship between the number of bedrooms and the price of a listing.

Time-Series Analysis: We will analyze the calendar data and identify patterns in the availability and price of listings over time. This analysis will help us understand how the prices of listings change over different seasons and how hosts can adjust their prices to maximize their revenue.

Geospatial Analysis: We will create interactive maps that display information about the listings' location and price. This analysis will help us understand the distribution of listings in Lisbon city and identify neighborhoods that are popular with guests.

# Description:
This project aims to provide insights to Airbnb hosts in Lisbon city on how to optimize their listings and maximize their revenue. The project will analyze the Airbnb data for Lisbon city, including detailed listings data, calendar data, and review data. The analysis will cover five main areas, including data cleaning and preparation, exploratory data analysis, basic statistics, time-series analysis, and geospatial analysis.

The analysis will begin with cleaning and preparing the data, ensuring that all numerical values are stored as floats or integers and all categorical variables are stored as strings. Once the data is cleaned and prepared, we will perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of variables and identify patterns and trends.

We will then use Numpy and Pandas to compute basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation between variables. This analysis will help us understand the average price of listings in Lisbon city and the relationship between the number of bedrooms and the price of a listing.

Next, we will analyze the calendar data and identify patterns in the availability and price of listings over time. This analysis will help us understand how the prices of listings change over different seasons and how hosts can adjust their prices to maximize their revenue.

Finally, we will create interactive maps that display information about the listings' location and price. This analysis will help us understand the distribution of listings in Lisbon city and identify neighborhoods that are popular with guests.

Overall, this project will provide valuable insights to Airbnb hosts in Lisbon city on how to optimize their listings and maximize their revenue.
